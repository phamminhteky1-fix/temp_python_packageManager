# Python Temponary Package Manager
This is the package manager that I used when developing Pythy in oder to save my storage from burning.

## How 2 use
1. Download the 'main.py' file
2. Rename it anything you want. Me persnonally, I use `packageMangager.py`
3. At the first lines of your code, write `from` [PACKAGE MANAGER FILENAME HERE] `import ensure_package, cleanup_packages` and then write `ensure_package("[Package name you want to install temponary]")`. Use seperate lines for seperate packages.
4. At the end of the code, add `cleanup_packages()` so it will clean up every package you installed at the first lines of code
5. You would like to watch this repo, since you don't want to miss updates.

Thats all. Hope it helps your storage!!!
